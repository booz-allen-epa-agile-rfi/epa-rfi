This fun picture shows how we decided to move forward with an idea in sprint zero but then after we found out that 

- the Google APIs would not provide us the information that we need
- we won't be able to use natural language processing (NLP) to parse through the label data and extract the adverse effects easily with 5 days

we decided to Pivot. The new idea is to replace NLP that we first thought about with using Crownsourcing to solve the same problem that we started to work on.
