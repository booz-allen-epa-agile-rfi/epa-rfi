#Responsive Design

Our front-end application was implemented with the Bootstrap framework to provide a completely responsive experience on all types of display sizes.  Our team conducted testing on multiple platforms (i.e. desktop, tablet, phone) and we conducted usability tests to observe users on these platforms.  Our front-end development team used the Google chrome mobile display test tool to rapidly emulate the experience of different platforms throughout the development process.

In addition that that we tested on multiple devices including the iphone, ipad and andriod.
