# Usability Testing

The first question we asked in our design kick-off was very simple: **"Who is this application for?"**

This customer focus started at the very beginning of our challenge, and became intertwined in the fabric of our development process. A great deal of our human centered design involved usability testing and market research. We spent a large portion of our time getting to know the users by creating personas that WILL be using the product. While this time allocation may have been different than other competitors, we believe that is crucial to designing a product that target audiences not only CAN use, but also WILL use.

The overall team had the opportunity to discuss the necessary data that will be focused for the User Stories and began thinking of the potential users who would be utilizing the application. After the meeting the team decided to target the “Concerned Citizen” that would be separated into four Personas: The Concerned Mother, The Environmentalist, The Academic and The Working Professional.

After we created our personas to find out exactly whom we were targeting, we moved on to conduct a total of four rounds of in-person and remotely-moderated usability testing on our wireframes and final developed mockups to determine qualitative behavioral data. We conducted these rounds with 4-6 people each, and after each round reviewed the results with the team, especially the designers who were working on the wireframes.

## Round 1 - Wireframe Usability Testing

In our first round of usability testing, we used the wireframes to get insight on the overall application. With some content and images still in the process we wanted our users to get an overall feel of the application. We had the opportunity to test with 6 individuals that provided us quick and positive results on the application. Our results were: 
* “I was able to recognize that this was a application that will be require me to put in a zip code”
* “I’m confused…but if I click the “How It Works” button I know I will learn more about it”
* “The large portion requires a map which will provide me information that I need on the right information bar”

## Round 2 - High Fidelity Mockup Usability Testing

Once the wireframes were finalized, we conducted our second round of usability testing on our mockups. We had the opportunity to do remote and in-person usability testing that provided us results that were used for recommendations on our designs. On this round of usability testing we had mix reviews on the application: Some users was overwhelmed at the application and wanted to click out. Two users wanted additional context before using the search feature and avoided the “How it Works” button. With these results, we provided recommendations to fix the design and utilized on our next iterations. At this point, the team was battling with data sets on the back-end development and was focused on that portion of the application. Finally, we drafted our proposed changes and documented
