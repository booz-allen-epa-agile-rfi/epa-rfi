# Human Centered Design Documentation

During this challenge, we used 8 core Human Centered Design (HCD) techniques: (1) Visioning exercise to brainstorm target groups, features/services to meet their needs; (2) Personas; (3) Journey Mapping; (4) User Stories; (5) Sketching screen designs; (6) Paper Prototyping with Wireframes; (7) Heuristic Reviews based on researched best practices and industry standards for designing for real, live people; (8) Usability testing in 2 small-scale iterative rounds of moderated in-person and remote testing. Here is an overview of our lean HCD process:

## Learning about the Data
We kicked off the first day with icebreakers and a data show-and-tell session from the product owners. The product owners went through the data by using Tableau, which displayed visualization on toxic releases, health effects and other data sets. The overall team had the opportunity to discuss the necessary data that will be focused for the User Stories and began to discuss potential users who would be utilizing the application. After the meeting the team decided to target the “Concerned Citizen” that would be separated into four Personas: The Concerned Mother, The Environmentalist, The Academic and The Working Professional.

## Market Research
To get an understanding of our users, a survey was sent out to understand if our users know about pollutants and toxins around their area. The survey would also help build our personas giving them real life evidence and research.

## Creating Personas
After completing research, we decided to flesh out each of the four Personas into more detail to guide the use-cases and design of the TREEview application. Our Personas were living documents that were updated as we learned more about our users. These documents also provided us a empathetic approach when we are going through user flows and user stories. They all had faces and names, and we spoke about them as if they were team members through the process. We got to know them as we designed and coded the application. Our wireframes were moved into usability testing and would be used to provide feedback on the design.

## User Stories
As a group, we determined the top tasks a user would do and defined them in a manner consistent with how each of our 4 unique personas would have stated them. We listed each of them, making sure to describe how we came about creating each of them in the [User Stories Documentation] (https://github.com/booz-allen-epa-agile-rfi/epa-rfi/blob/master/documentation/User-Stories.md) page



## Journey Mapping/Task Analysis
We drafted journey maps for each persona for the TREEview experience to help shape our flows. Each of the following artifacts represent how our 4 indiviudal users would experience a loop on the site.

## Sketching and Collaboration
Our next step brought us to basic sketches on what the front-end could look like for the application to highlight our user stories, use cases, and journeys.  These initial views allowed the full team to get a quick glimpse into the identity of the application and to seek out any functionality we felt was still missing from this first pass.

## Paper Prototyping Wireframes

After confirming our initial design was consistent with our user stories and personas, we drafted a few more iterations of the wireframes and illustrated them digitally. Our goal was to get the opinions of some actual people to perform usability testing on our wireframe design. We printed them out, sought out some nearby colleagues, and conducted a heuristic review based on industry best practices and recommended enhancements to the navigation, presentation, content and interaction represented in the wireframe. As the developers began building the basic front-end and backend functionality, the design team worked in parallel to continue usability testing and updated the design of TREEview with new recommendations for the look, layout, and various copy elements.

## Usability Testing

We performed numerous small-scale, iterative rounds of usability testing both in-person and remotely through Google Hangout interviews. All of our usability testing was moderated because we were most interested in behavioral, qualitative feedback from our key target audiences. With our intense timeline, usability testing was important to validate and confirm our design assumptions. The results enabled us to provide more recommendations as we began to create higher-fidelity user interfaces for the TREEview application.
