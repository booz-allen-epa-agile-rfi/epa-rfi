## Brainstorming 

As the team began working on the project, the aggressive delivery timeline prompted all hands-on deck to begin working together and thinking about ideas.

The team initialized a group-wide brainstorming session through a conference call and began reviewing the provided data sets together. Our initial review of the data started to bring out potential user stories [https://github.com/booz-allen-epa-agile-rfi/epa-rfi/blob/1e68301df78f893ff26e7cb21333af1c404a023a/documentation/User-Stories.md] and we created four Personas [LINK?] to design this application around

* The Concerned Mother
* The Environmentalist
* The Academic
* The Working Professional

These personas provided us a scope to design user journeys around and guided each step of our design process. We worked with EPA SMEs to make the personas as realistic and started sketching how to best present information from the provided datasets.

## Wireframes

The design team started to sketch wireframes while working as the UX drilled into the data sets to generate formal user stories. The sketches included numerous iterations that provided the team great artifacts for upcoming sprints. At this stage, the designers worked closely with the front-end developers to provide the first page view that allowed the developers to start building the front-end skeleton for the user interface. 

The wireframes underwent three iterations, which provided the entire team a view on the functionality and how the data was represented on the application.

## Logo Creation and Brand Development

We determined that our application needed appropriate branding in order to have a big impact on our target personas. After careful consideration of the client’s needs, the team brainstormed on numerous naming conventions that could cater to the EPA. 

TREEVIEW (Toxics Release & Emissions Environment View) was the final name the team settled on. We felt this name was appropriate because of the environmental agenda the application was representing and how the application shows data ‘branching’ into different health effects in the United States.

Having the name enabled us to go straight into sketching to quickly create some potential logos for the application. The designers experimented with multiple ideas, but we went with a simple typographic treatment to keep the branding simple as that is how we believe we are expressing the information from the datasets.

The sketches were reviewed, and our final choice was taken into Adobe Illustrator to design further. We chose a few color schemes that best matched the aspirations of our branding and created two logos in a higher-fidelity fashion to iterate upon further.

The team reviewed these two logos with the client to be used in the application and decided on the left option before moving forward with creating a final version of the logo. The final color scheme was ultimately decided upon to closely match the 18F U.S. Web Standards.

The combination of a final logo and numerous iterations of the wireframes allowed us to dive deep on the design of the graphical user interface (GUI) for the application. This digital collaboration effort enabled us to quickly review and address any functional or design issues uncovered while working on the app. Constant communication between the front-end team and the design team over ZOOM conferencing and Google Hangouts facilitated design and decision-making, which quickly allowed us to produce a functioning landing page and higher-fidelity UI mockups.

## Mockups 

The design team moved forward on creating mockups that were consistent with the 18F U.S. Web Design Standards. By transitioning from the wireframes to the mockup, our designer was able to provide the developers a high-fidelity design that incorporated our user stories and a great user experience that could be quickly translated into the application’s front-end design.

## Style Guide

The ultimate product of our design process is a Style Guide that can be quickly referenced to make changes or updates to the overall user interface. We documented each individual aspect of this in the [Style Guide] (https://github.com/booz-allen-epa-agile-rfi/epa-rfi/blob/master/documentation/Style-Guide.md) page
