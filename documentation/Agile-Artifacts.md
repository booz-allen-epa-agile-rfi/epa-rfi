**Our Agile Process**

We executed this challenge with an agile approach, delivering working software daily, and building in a culture of inspect-and-adapt. 

We set an initial plan to work for 3 days as a whole team, then make a team decision how to proceed -- did we feel the solution was good enough, 
and we could close the project? Or did we want to proceed with further development?

We had an part-time agile coach to help guide our process and encourage whole-team collaboration. 

**Sprint Zero**

Before we began core development, we spent a couple of days in our Sprint 0: forming the team,
setting up our development environment, exploring the dataset, and going through initial ideation with user-centered design techniques. 

We also set up sufficient technology to keep us collaborating throughout the process, despite the fact that team members
were gegraphically distributed. To aid in this, we kept up a Zoom video call throughout the development period, Slack for team messaging and sharing, and 
task-tracking via Waffle.io/GitHub.

Day 1 (Wed) was characterized with two sprints, of 3 hours each, each ending in a demo, as well as a retrospective for the end of the day.  

In Day 2 (Thurs), the team decided that planning a single sprint for the day would be a more effective strategy, with numerous cross-team synchronizations and meetings occurring 
within.

Day 3 (Fri) began with a full-team demo of current progress, and opportunity for feedback, then a further retrospective, to continue to hone the way we work.
We then planned the day's work and planned for a review and retrospective at the end of the day.

Day 1
- Sprint 1 (3 hours)
- Sprint 2 (3 hours)

Day 2 - Minimum Viable Product
- Sprint 3 (8 hours)
- The goal for this day was to end with a demonstrable slice of the application's functionality, connecting the user to the valuable data and visulizations

Day 3 - Release 1 (Day 3)
- Sprint 4 (8 hours)


As we executed, we followed a simple pattern: 
 1. Release Planning - Plan each day as a release
 1. Sprint Planning - Plan and execute 1-2 sprints per day, using whole-team estimation and buy-in
 1. Sprint Demonstration - Demo each Sprint's output, receiving feedback from the team and interested parties
 1. Retrospective - Conduct a retrospective after each release, to adapt our work for the next release

Work was captured as user stories (expressing a need and value), and broken down into technical tasks. 
We estimated each task and captured the planned user stories for each sprint. 
We also captured the velocity for each sprint and used that as input into our next sprints. 

User stories are archived on our wiki here - https://github.com/booz-allen-epa-agile-rfi/epa-rfi/wiki/User-Stories
