TREEView is a data-driven platform with the goal of helping the user discover where chemical emissions are coming from in their local community using the latest information from the [EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory](http://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/tri-basic-plus-data-files-calendar-years-1987-2014).   Through TREEView, a concerned citizen is able to filter through EPA information by chemical type, related health effects, and facilities to provide the data in a way that meets an individual need.   

Booz Allen Digital offers key strengths to the EPA OEI:

- **Demonstrated Agile Delivery** – Our firm has strong experience with agile software development as demonstrated on this prototype as well as on GSA Integrated Award Environment (IAE), GSA 18F, numerous hackathons, and many other federal and commercial engagements.  For this engagement, we were able to pull together an agile team across three time zones and demonstrate distributed DevOps.

- **A Culture of Innovation** - Booz Allen's dedication to creating a culture of innovation resulted in the Strategic Innovation Group (SIG), a 1,800 person division whose mission it is to ensure there is focus on agile, digital, next gen analytics and cyber security for all modern solutions.

- **Cross-functional agile skilled staff with reach back to domain SME** – Booz Allen was able to quickly assemble a highly-skilled, cross-functional team for this effort. Booz Allen has deep knowledge of federal agencies missions and a staff embedded with the EPA OEI.

### Digital Services Playbook

We closely followed the Digital Services playbook guidelines as detailed in the link below: 

https://github.com/booz-allen-epa-agile-rfi/epa-rfi/blob/master/documentation/U.S.-Digital-Services-Playbook-Evidence.md

### Technical Approach 

We assigned one leader, our Product Owner (PO), who had the authority, responsibility, and was held accountable for the quality of our TREEView prototype submission.

**(a) User-Centered Design**

From the beginning of our prototype development, we included ‘people’ throughout the process to understand their needs and get their feedback on our design and development.  An overview of our lean HCD process:

**(b) DevOps Approach**

We took a DevOps approach to the workflow for this prototype:

**(c) Agile Software Development**

We developed TREEView using our iterative agile process:

https://github.com/booz-allen-epa-agile-rfi/epa-rfi/blob/master/documentation/Agile-Artifacts.md

**(d) Agile Architecture**

We only used open source technologies and open sourced our TREEView prototype.

Licenses for open source technologies:

https://github.com/booz-allen-epa-agile-rfi/epa-rfi/blob/master/documentation/Licenses.md

**(e) Modular Development**

We developed TREEView with 14 modern, open source technologies most appropriate to implement the prototype.   Our approach:

**(f) Test Driven Development**

To support agile development we took an automated testing approach:

https://github.com/booz-allen-epa-agile-rfi/epa-rfi/blob/master/documentation/Automated-Testing.md

**(g) API First Design**

We implemented API First Design by starting with our Human Centered Design: 

https://github.com/booz-allen-epa-agile-rfi/epa-rfi/blob/master/documentation/Human-Centered-Design.md

and our DevOps process:
